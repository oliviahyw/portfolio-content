            <img src="image/project2_moving.png" alt="From outputs to outcomes" width="500"/>
            <p>
                The client is not mature in defining KPI's, we had to bring them examples of what to measure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Struggle navigating '5 why' conversations with Product Owners as they do not understand the end objective- want a framework to point to help navigate those conversations
            </p>
            <p>
                Some 'innovation factories' and other Garage engagements identified KPIs that are fuzzier on business impact, but demonstrate other metrics of value to the client
            </p>
            <h5>Exposures to best practices are needed to show what to deliver:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Frameworks, exercises, practices</li>
                <li>Visual communication of value to clients</li>
                <li>Examples of metrics to measure</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Coaching and training are needed to show how and why to deliver:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Establishing a value language with clients</li>
                <li>Moving beyond product-value metrics</li>
                <li>A clear focus on measurable business returns</li>
                <li>Garage-wide ROI roll up vs. Individual initiatives</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who is this for?</h2>
            <p>Garage leaders can come from any background.</p>

            <p>
                Leadership is asking them to take on activities they may have limited exposure or limited training.
            </p>
            <p>
                Strong coaching and constant exposure to value conversations- yielded team of business results- focused leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Peers and colleagues are the number one reported source for where individuals go for advice and help about their Garage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Best practices are coming from longer-term engagements with a focus on developing a value language with their clients at the forming stages of the Garage and with teams dedicated in linking value throughout.

            <h2>Holistic framework to embrace Outcomes over Outputs</h2>

            <p>
                IBM Garage Outcomes consists of two parts: microsite is used to explain to Garage Leaders how to understand & identify, measure & track, and communicate value; outcomes tool is used to help Garage Leaders calculate key metrics that reflect value in a step-by-step manner that is easy to understand.

            <h2>Outcomes Tool - Mapping</h2>
            <p>
                *Example:<br>There is a step in the process on 25% of interactions in which a CSR must contact a local delivery partner in order to achieve customer resolution this interaction takes the CSR on average 17 minutesThe team wants to explore a partner blockchain that would allow real-time visibility across the client's partner network - saving the CSR 16min
